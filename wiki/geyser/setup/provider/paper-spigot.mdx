import { Versions } from '@site/src/components/Versions'

:::info
If your server is not running <Versions platform="java"/>, you will need to install <a href="https://viaversion.com/">ViaVersion</a>.
See also [this page](/wiki/geyser/supported-versions/) on supported versions.

1. 选择你的面板服务商查看相关事项.
2. [点击下载合适的 Geyser 版本](/download).
3. 将 Geyser 文件放入 `plugins` 文件夹, 然后重启服务器.
4. 打开 Geyser 配置文件夹内的 `config.yml`, 你将会看到如下内容:

    ```yaml
    bedrock: 
        # The IP address that will listen for connections. 
        # Generally, you should only uncomment and change this if you want to limit what IPs can connect to your server. 
        #address: 0.0.0.0 

        # The port that will listen for connections. This is the port that Bedrock players will use to connect to your server.
        port: 19132 

        # Some hosting services change your Java port everytime you start the server and require the same port to be used for Bedrock. 
        # This option makes the Bedrock port the same as the Java port every time you start the server. 
        # This option is for the plugin version only. 
        clone-remote-port: false 
    ``` 
    The vital part is the port. This is the port that Bedrock players will use to connect to your server. 
    Follow the instructions in the provider selector - change the port, and if necessary, `clone-remote-port` & `address`.
    If `clone-remote-port` is enabled, the bedrock port will be overwritten with the Java port!   
    **Important**: Other services/plugins that rely on ports with UDP, such as Voice Chats or Query, cannot share the port with Geyser.
 
5. Verify whether connections are possible by running `geyser connectiontest <ip> <port>` in the console.

To allow Bedrock Edition players to join your server without needing to log in to a paid Java Edition account, you can use <a href="/wiki/floodgate/setup/">Floodgate</a>.
