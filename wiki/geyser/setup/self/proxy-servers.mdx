:::info
- 请仅在代理服务端上安装 Geyser! Floodgate 允许并建议安装在所有子服务器.
- 如果基岩版玩家想要进入一个子服, 那么这个子服必须允许 <Versions platform="java"/> Java 客户端.
:::

1. [点击下载合适的 Geyser 版本](/download).
2. 将 Geyser 文件放入 `plugins` 文件夹, 然后重启服务器.
3. 打开 Geyser 配置文件夹内的 `config.yml`, 你将会看到如下内容:

    ```yaml
    bedrock:
      # 允许访问的 IP 地址
      # 通常来说, 你不应该取消注释, 除非你要限制只有来自某个 IP 地址的访问被允许.
      #address: 0.0.0.0

      # 基岩版 服务器端口.
      port: 19132
    ```
    The vital part is the port. This is the port that Bedrock players will use to connect to your server!
    If you enable `clone-remote-port`, the port will be overridden and the Java port is used.
    Since you are self-hosting, you can choose the port freely - the default port is 19132.   
   **Important**: Other services/plugins that rely on ports with UDP, such as Voice Chats or Query, cannot share the port with Geyser.
     

4. Connecting to your server
        
    **Connecting locally in the same network**   
    On the same device as the server, you can connect using `localhost`, or `127.0.0.1` as the address.
    Do note: When hosting and playing on the same Windows device, you will need the [loopback fix](/wiki/geyser/fixing-unable-to-connect-to-world#using-geyser-on-the-same-computer).
    Other devices in the same local network can use your local IPv4 to connect - it starts with `10.` or `192.168.`.
        
    **Connecting from a different network**  
    You will need to expose the port Geyser runs on to the Internet if you want players from outside your network to join.
    To achieve that, you have two options:   

    - Port forwarding: Open the Geyser port (e.g. 19132) on the UDP protocol in your router/modem, and in the Windows/Linux firewall.
   [Our port forwarding guide](/wiki/geyser/port-forwarding) explains how to do this in detail.
   Then, players can connect with your public IPv4 + port to your server.   

    - playit.gg: Instead of opening a port (which might not be an option/if you do not want to expose your home ip), you can use
   the playit.gg service to create a tunnel for you to route the traffic through. See our [playit.gg guide](/wiki/geyser/playit-gg).
   Ngrok will not work since it is TCP-only.   

5. Verify whether connections from other networks are possible by running `geyser connectiontest <ip> <port>` in the console.
